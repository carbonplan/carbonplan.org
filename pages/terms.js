            code, content, data, suggestion, feedback, or any other information)
            to us, including through our Services, you will and hereby do grant

            license to copy, modify, distribute, publicly display and publicly
            perform Your Content in all forms of media for the purpose of
            providing the Services, including without limitation sharing Your
            Content with other users, analyzing it on our servers, making
            production, archival and backup copies, and improving the Services
            over time. <br />
            <br />
            <i>Licensing Your Content to Other Users</i>: If you post Your

            use, display and perform Your Content, as permitted through the
            functionality of the Service. If you contribute Your Content to any
            portion of the Services that requires you to grant a specific
            additional license to other users, such as a public license, you
            will and hereby do grant that license to us, and to the other users
            of the Services. By way of example, whenever you add Your Content to
            one of our code repositories containing notice of a license, you
            license that content under the same terms, unless we have a separate
            contributor license agreement that specifies different terms. In
            addition, we may specify that submissions to certain portions of our
            Websites must be made pursuant a public license, such as CC-BY 4.0,
            and when you make such a submission then Your Content shall be, and
            is, licensed under the terms of the license we specify. If you do
            not want to license Your Content under the specified license, then
            you should not submit Your Content.

            any of the Services in its sole discretion. Removal of any of Your
            Content from the Services (by you or CarbonPlan) does not impact any
